TODO: this is special because it gets imported during build.
The Symbol used to tag the ReactElement-like types. If there is no native Symbol
nor polyfill, then a plain number is used for performance.
Helps identify side effects in begin-phase lifecycle hooks and setState reducers:
This can be confusing for tests though,
And it can be bad for performance in production.
This feature flag can be used to control the behavior:
replay the begin phase of a failed component inside invokeGuardedCallback.
TODO: true? Here it might just be false.
Only used in www builds.
with their related DOM properties
Control this behavior with a flag to support 16.6 minor releases in the meanwhile.
Relying on the `invariant()` implementation lets us
preserve the format and params in the www builds.
Avoid an extra prototype jump for these methods.
an immutable object with a single mutable value
Note: some APIs are added with feature flags.
Make sure that stable builds for open source
don't modify the React object to avoid deopts.
Also let's not expose their names in stable builds.
TODO: decide on the top-level export form.
This is hacky but makes it work with both Rollup and Jest.
